<em> Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' <br>
We are not now that strength which in old days <br>
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are; <br>
One equal temper of heroic hearts, <br>
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will <br>
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. </em> <br><br>
