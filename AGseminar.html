      Title: <em>Zero-sum cycles in flexible polyhedra</em>
      <br>
      <br>
    Abstract:  We show that if a polyhedron in the three-dimensional affine space with triangular faces is flexible, 
      i.e., can be continuously deformed preserving the shape of its faces, then there is a cycle of edges whose 
      lengths sum up to zero once suitably weighted by 1 and -1. We do this via elementary combinatorial considerations, 
      made possible by a well-known compactification of the three-dimensional affine space as a quadric in the 
      four-dimensional projective space. The compactification is related to the Euclidean metric, and allows us 
      to use a simple degeneration technique that reduces the problem to its one-dimensional analogue, which is trivial 
      to solve. This is a joint work with G. Grasegger, J. Legerský, and J. Schicho.

    Title: <em>Subvarieties of general hypersurfaces and their degree of irrationality</em>
      <br>
      <br>
    Abstract: I will be interested in discussing various birational invariants describing how a given variety X is far from being rational. 
      After introducing these invariants, I will focus on the case where X is a general hypersurface of large degree in the complex projective space. 
      In particular, I will report on recent results in collaboration with C. Ciliberto, F. Flamini and P. Supino, concerning the least degree 
      of irrationality of irreducible subvarieties of X of fixed dimension passing through a general point of X.

      Title: <em>Primary ideals and their differential equations</em>
      <br>
      <br>
    Abstract: An ideal in a polynomial ring encodes a system of linear partial differential equations with constant coefficients. 
      Primary decomposition organizes the solutions to the PDE. This paper develops a novel structure theory for primary ideals 
      in a polynomial ring. We characterize primary ideals in terms of PDE, punctual Hilbert schemes, relative Weyl algebras, 
      and the join construction. Solving the PDE described by a primary ideal amounts to computing Noetherian operators in the 
      sense of Ehrenpreis and Palamodov. We develop new algorithms for this task, and we present efficient implementations.

    Title: <em>Tangential weak defectiveness and generic identifiability</em>
    <br>
    <br>
    Abstract: We study the uniqueness of decomposition of general tensors T as a sum of tensors of rank 1. This is done by 
    extending the theory developed in a previous work by Mella to the framework of non-tangentially-weak-defective varieties. 
    In particular, the infinitesimal behaviour of the tangential contact locus is linked to the birational geometry of a 
    weakly defective but not tangentially defective variety. In this way it is possible to prove the non generic identifiability
    of infinitely many partially symmetric tensors.
