      Title: <em>Zero-sum cycles in flexible polyhedra</em>
      <br>
      <br>
    Abstract:  We show that if a polyhedron in the three-dimensional affine space with triangular faces is flexible, 
      i.e., can be continuously deformed preserving the shape of its faces, then there is a cycle of edges whose 
      lengths sum up to zero once suitably weighted by 1 and -1. We do this via elementary combinatorial considerations, 
      made possible by a well-known compactification of the three-dimensional affine space as a quadric in the 
      four-dimensional projective space. The compactification is related to the Euclidean metric, and allows us 
      to use a simple degeneration technique that reduces the problem to its one-dimensional analogue, which is trivial 
      to solve. This is a joint work with G. Grasegger, J. Legerský, and J. Schicho.

      Title: <em>Primary ideals and their differential equations</em>
      <br>
      <br>
    Abstract: An ideal in a polynomial ring encodes a system of linear partial differential equations with constant coefficients. 
      Primary decomposition organizes the solutions to the PDE. This paper develops a novel structure theory for primary ideals 
      in a polynomial ring. We characterize primary ideals in terms of PDE, punctual Hilbert schemes, relative Weyl algebras, 
      and the join construction. Solving the PDE described by a primary ideal amounts to computing Noetherian operators in the 
      sense of Ehrenpreis and Palamodov. We develop new algorithms for this task, and we present efficient implementations.
