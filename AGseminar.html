Title: <em>Torus actions from the viewpoint of birational geometry</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  In this talk we focus on complex, smooth, projective varieties  admitting a non-trivial C*-action. 
    We introduce a new approach to investigate such varieties, using instruments coming from birational geometry.
    In particular, we relate small bandwidth varieties with Atiyah flips and special Cremona transformations. 
    We report recent classification results of small bandwidth varieties, with particular  attention to the case of 
    bandwidth 3. We finally discuss some  applications, in the framework of LeBrun-Salamon conjecture. This is a 
    joint project with G. Occhetta, L. Solá Conde and J. Wiśniewski.

Title: <em>Gale duality, blowups and moduli spaces</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  The Gale correspondence provides a duality between sets of n points in projective spaces <b>P</b><sup>s</sup> and 
        <b>P</b><sup>r</sup> when n=r+s+2. For small values of s, this duality has a remarkable geometric manifestation: 
        the blowup of <b>P</b><sup>r</sup> at n points can be realized as a moduli space of vector bundles on the blowup of <b>P</b><sup>s</sup> 
        at the Gale dual points. We explore this realization to describe the birational geometry of blowups 
        of projective spaces at points in very general position. We will focus in particular on the cases 
        where the blowup fails to be a Mori Dream Space, reporting on a joint work with Carolina Araujo, Ana-Maria Castravet and Inder Kaur.

Title: <em>Higher rank motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  We define the Grothendieck ring of varieties and the power structure on it. We then present some formulae
      expressing the naive motive of the Quot scheme of points on a 3-fold, as opposed to its <em>virtual motive</em>,
      also known as <em>motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariant</em>. In the virtual setup, we will focus mainly on the case of
      affine 3-space, on which the global case is suitably modelled. The final formula for the generating function of 
      the virtual motives fully solves the higher rank DT theory of a pair (X,F) = (3-fold,vector bundle).

Title: <em>Intrinsic Grassmannians</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  Generalizing the well-known weighted Grassmanians introduced by Corti and Reid, we study certain geometric 
      invariant theory quotients of the affine cone over the Plücker embedding of Gr(k,n). More precisely, 
      we consider normal projective varieties whose Cox ring is defined by the Plücker ideal I_{k,n}. For k = 2, 
      we classify the smooth Fano ones having Picard number two and give a concrete formula to compute their number for arbitrary n.
