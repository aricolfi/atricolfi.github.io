<li><em> A building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it. Symbols are given power by people. 
  Alone, a symbol is meaningless, but with enough people, blowing up a building can change the world</em>.<br>
[V for vendetta, 2006]
  </ul> 
  
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li><em> I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. 
  And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. 
  Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone</em>.<br>
  [The Shawshank Redemption, 1994]

<li><em> 
  I was only a boy, but the image of my father holding the woman he loved 
  for the last time has remained with me throughout the years</em>.<br>

   <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li><em> 
  Makers of men, creators of leaders- be careful what kind of leaders you're producing here. I don't know if Charlie's 
  silence here today is right or wrong; I'm not a judge or jury. But I can tell you this: he won't sell anybody 
  out to buy his future! And that, my friends, is called integrity. That's called courage. 
  Now that's the stuff leaders should be made of</em>.<br>

  When people ask me if Michael Sullivan was a good man, or if there was just no good in him at all, 
  I always give the same answer. I just tell them... he was my father</em>.<br>
