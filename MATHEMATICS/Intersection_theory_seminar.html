<em>Chapter 1 &#8211; The Chow group, proper pushforward and flat pullback</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  This is the first seminar on intersection theory. Firstly I will introduce the definition 
of k- cycles and rational equivalence, then I will explain how proper pushforward and flat pullback act on cycles. 
During the seminar there will be many examples.

<em>Chapter 2 &#8211; Intersecting with divisors</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  This is the second seminar on intersection theory. It will cover the second chapter of Fulton's book. 
The aim is to describe how to intersect a divisor with a k-cycle on an integral variety.
Some properties of this operation, such as its commutativity in particular cases, will be discussed during the talk.

<em>Chapter 3 &#8211; Vector bundles and Chern classes I</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  This is the third seminar on intersection theory. It will cover the first two sections of the third chapter 
of Fulton's book (From page 47 to page 64 (ยง3.3 excluded)).
I will explain the construction of the "Chern Class" operations associated to a vector bundle on a scheme, study their properties, and give some examples.

<li> Thursday, March 4th at 16:30, Vadym Kurylenko (SISSA).

<em>Chapter 3 &#8211; Vector bundles and Chern classes II</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract: Next Thursday we will start by going through a part of the appendix. We will discuss things such as bundles, 
  blow-ups and different types of cones. After that we will finish chapter 3 of the book and talk about Chow groups of bundles. 
  In particular, I will sketch a proof of some isomorphisms between Chow groups of the bundle and the base space. 
  We will finish by discussing the Gysin morphisms and considering a number of examples if time permits.
