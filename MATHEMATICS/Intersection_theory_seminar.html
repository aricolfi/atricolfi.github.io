  <br>
  <br>
<em>Chapter 1</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  This is the first seminar on intersection theory. Firstly I will introduce the definition 
of k- cycles and rational equivalence, then I will explain how proper pushforward and flat pullback act on cycles. 
During the seminar there will be many examples.

<li> Thursday, February 18th at 16:30, Riccardo Ontani (SISSA).

<em>Chapter 2</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  This is the second seminar on intersection theory. It will cover the second chapter of Fulton's book. 
The aim is to describe how to intersect a divisor with a k-cycle on an integral variety.
Some properties of this operation, such as its commutativity in particular cases, will be discussed during the talk.
