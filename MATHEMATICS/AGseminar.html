Title: <em>Weyl cycles on blow-ups of projective 4-spaces</em>
   <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  I will introduce the definition of Weyl cycles on the blow-up X of P^n in a collection of points in general position. 
   These are irreducible components of the intersection of pairwise orthogonal effective divisors on X that live 
   in the Weyl orbit of exceptional divisors, where the orthogonality is taken with respect to a Dolgachev-Mukai pairing 
   on the Picard group of X. In the case where X is a Mori dream space of dimension four or less, we can describe the geometry 
   of and classify these objects. I will also explain how this relates to certain polynomial interpolation problems.
This is joint work with M. C. Brambilla and O. Dumitrescu.

Title: <em>Geometry of tensor network varieties</em>
   <br>
  <br>
Abstract: Tensor network varieties are varieties of tensors described by the combinatorial structure of a graph. 
  They play a major role in quantum many-body physics as well as in other areas of applied mathematics, such as algebraic 
  complexity theory and algebraic statistics.
In this seminar, I will introduce tensor network varieties, focusing on their geometric structure. 
I will show how to study their dimension, equations, and special subvarieties of interest.
