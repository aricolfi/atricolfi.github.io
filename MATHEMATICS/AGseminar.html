Title: <em>Higher rank K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of points</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  From the moduli spaces of sheaves on a complex algebraic variety one can extract many interesting invariants of 
  various nature, which are in general very difficult to compute and rarely described by explicit closed formulae. We start 
  reviewing classical results on topological invariants of Hilbert schemes of points for curves and surfaces and then turn 
  to the case of threefolds, where Donaldson-Thomas theory is defined. As an example, we present and prove a closed formula 
  for higher rank K-theoretic DT invariants of points, which solves a conjecture proposed in String Theory. 
  This is based on joint work with N. Fasola and A. Ricolfi.

Title: <em>Geometry of genus 1 fine compactified Jacobians</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  A classical construction in algebraic geometry associates with every nonsingular complex projective curve its Jacobian, 
  a complex projective variety of dimension equal to the genus of the curve. A similar construction is available for singular curves, 
  but the resulting Jacobian variety fails in general to be compact. In this talk we introduce a general abstract notion of fine 
  compactified Jacobian for nodal curves of arbitrary genus. We focus on genus 1 and discuss combinatorial classification 
  results for fine compactified Jacobians in the case of a single stable curve, and in the case of the universal family over 
  the moduli space of stable pointed curves.  In the former case, our abstract notion finds back objects that had 
  already been constructed by Oda-Seshadri and others. In the latter case our complete classification exhibits new examples. 
  We then discuss how to calculate the cohomology of these compactified Jacobians. A joint work with Orsola Tommasi.

Title: <em>Torus actions from the viewpoint of birational geometry</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  In this talk we focus on complex, smooth, projective varieties  admitting a non-trivial C*-action. 
    We introduce a new approach to investigate such varieties, using instruments coming from birational geometry.
    In particular, we relate small bandwidth varieties with Atiyah flips and special Cremona transformations. 
    We report recent classification results of small bandwidth varieties, with particular  attention to the case of 
    bandwidth 3. We finally discuss some  applications, in the framework of LeBrun-Salamon conjecture. This is a 
    joint project with G. Occhetta, L. Solá Conde and J. Wiśniewski.

Title: <em>Gale duality, blowups and moduli spaces</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  The Gale correspondence provides a duality between sets of n points in projective spaces <b>P</b><sup>s</sup> and 
        <b>P</b><sup>r</sup> when n=r+s+2. For small values of s, this duality has a remarkable geometric manifestation: 
        the blowup of <b>P</b><sup>r</sup> at n points can be realized as a moduli space of vector bundles on the blowup of <b>P</b><sup>s</sup> 
        at the Gale dual points. We explore this realization to describe the birational geometry of blowups 
        of projective spaces at points in very general position. We will focus in particular on the cases 
        where the blowup fails to be a Mori Dream Space, reporting on a joint work with Carolina Araujo, Ana-Maria Castravet and Inder Kaur.

Title: <em>Higher rank motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  We define the Grothendieck ring of varieties and the power structure on it. We then present some formulae
      expressing the naive motive of the Quot scheme of points on a 3-fold, as opposed to its <em>virtual motive</em>,
      also known as <em>motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariant</em>. In the virtual setup, we will focus mainly on the case of
      affine 3-space, on which the global case is suitably modelled. The final formula for the generating function of 
      the virtual motives fully solves the higher rank DT theory of a pair (X,F) = (3-fold,vector bundle).
