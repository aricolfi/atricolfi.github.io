Title: <em>Holomorphic one forms on moduli of curves</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract: It is a classical result from the sixties that the moduli space of smooth projective curves Mg 
  does not have non-trivial closed holomorphic 1-forms, for genus g > 2. In the talk I present a stronger 
  result recently proven in collaboration with F. Favale and G.P. Pirola that the moduli space Mg does 
  not have holomorphic 1-forms at all, even not closed, at least for genus g ≥ 5. Time permitting, 
  I will then discuss further applications of the developed techniques.

Title: <em>Almost perfect obstruction theory and K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas invariants</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract: Perfect obstruction theories are a fundamental ingredient used to define invariants associated to 
   moduli problems, such as virtual cycles in the Chow group and virtual structure sheaves in K-theory. 
   However, several moduli spaces, such as the moduli space of simple perfect complexes and desingularizations 
   of moduli stacks of semistable sheaves on Calabi-Yau threefolds, do not admit a perfect obstruction theory. 
   In this talk, we introduce the relaxed notion of an almost perfect obstruction theory on a Deligne-Mumford 
   stack and show that it gives rise to a virtual structure sheaf in its K-theory. This applies to many examples 
   of interest, including the above, and enables us to define K-theoretic virtual invariants and, in particular, 
   K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of sheaves and complexes on Calabi-Yau threefolds. Based on joint work with Young-Hoon Kiem.

Title: <em>The adjoint of a polytope</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  This talk brings many areas together: discrete geometry, statistics, intersection theory, 
  classical algebraic geometry, physics, and geometric modeling. First, we recall the definitions of the 
  adjoint of a polytope given Wachspress in 1975 and by Warren in 1996 in the context of geometric modeling. 
  They defined this polynomial to generalize barycentric coordinates from simplices to arbitrary polytopes. 
  Secondly, we show how this polynomial appears in statistics (as the numerator of a generating function over 
  all moments of the uniform probability distribution on a polytope), in intersection theory (as the central 
  piece in Segre classes of monomial schemes), and in physics (when studying scattering amplitudes). 
  Thirdly, we show that the adjoint is the unique polynomial of minimal degree which vanishes on the non-faces 
  of a simple polytope. Finally, we observe that adjoints of polytopes are special cases of the classical 
  notion of adjoints of divisors. Since the adjoint of a simple polytope is unique, the corresponding divisors 
  have unique canonical curves. In the case of three-dimensional polytopes, we show that these divisors 
  are either K3 or elliptic surfaces.
This talk is based on joint works with Kristian Ranestad, Boris Shapiro and Bernd Sturmfels.
