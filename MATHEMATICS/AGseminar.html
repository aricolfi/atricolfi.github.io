Title: <em>Higher rank K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of points</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  From the moduli spaces of sheaves on a complex algebraic variety one can extract many interesting invariants of 
  various nature, which are in general very difficult to compute and rarely described by explicit closed formulae. We start 
  reviewing classical results on topological invariants of Hilbert schemes of points for curves and surfaces and then turn 
  to the case of threefolds, where Donaldson-Thomas theory is defined. As an example, we present and prove a closed formula 
  for higher rank K-theoretic DT invariants of points, which solves a conjecture proposed in String Theory. 
  This is based on joint work with N. Fasola and A. Ricolfi.
