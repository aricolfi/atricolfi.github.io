Title: <em>Holomorphic one forms on moduli of curves</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract: It is a classical result from the sixties that the moduli space of smooth projective curves Mg 
  does not have non-trivial closed holomorphic 1-forms, for genus g > 2. In the talk I present a stronger 
  result recently proven in collaboration with F. Favale and G.P. Pirola that the moduli space Mg does 
  not have holomorphic 1-forms at all, even not closed, at least for genus g ≥ 5. Time permitting, 
  I will then discuss further applications of the developed techniques.

Title: <em>The adjoint of a polytope</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  This talk brings many areas together: discrete geometry, statistics, intersection theory, 
  classical algebraic geometry, physics, and geometric modeling. First, we recall the definitions of the 
  adjoint of a polytope given Wachspress in 1975 and by Warren in 1996 in the context of geometric modeling. 
  They defined this polynomial to generalize barycentric coordinates from simplices to arbitrary polytopes. 
  Secondly, we show how this polynomial appears in statistics (as the numerator of a generating function over 
  all moments of the uniform probability distribution on a polytope), in intersection theory (as the central 
  piece in Segre classes of monomial schemes), and in physics (when studying scattering amplitudes). 
  Thirdly, we show that the adjoint is the unique polynomial of minimal degree which vanishes on the non-faces 
  of a simple polytope. Finally, we observe that adjoints of polytopes are special cases of the classical 
  notion of adjoints of divisors. Since the adjoint of a simple polytope is unique, the corresponding divisors 
  have unique canonical curves. In the case of three-dimensional polytopes, we show that these divisors 
  are either K3 or elliptic surfaces.
This talk is based on joint works with Kristian Ranestad, Boris Shapiro and Bernd Sturmfels.

Title: <em>Geometry of tensor network varieties</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract: Tensor network varieties are varieties of tensors described by the combinatorial structure of a graph. 
  They play a major role in quantum many-body physics as well as in other areas of applied mathematics, such as algebraic 
  complexity theory and algebraic statistics.
In this seminar, I will introduce tensor network varieties, focusing on their geometric structure. 
I will show how to study their dimension, equations, and special subvarieties of interest.
