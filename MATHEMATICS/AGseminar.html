Title: <em>Higher rank K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of points</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract: A classical way to produce (numerical) invariants is through intersection theory, 
  usually on a smooth projective variety. We give a gentle introduction on how to use torus 
  actions to refine invariants in several directions, for example K-theoretic and virtual invariants. 
  As a concrete example, we explain how to extract meaningful invariants from the Quot schemes of quasi-projective 
  smooth toric threefolds and how to refine them. We present and prove various closed formulas for different 
  flavours of higher rank Donaldson-Thomas invariants of points, solving a series of conjectures proposed in String Theory. 
  This is based on joint work with N. Fasola and A. Ricolfi.

Title: <em>Cox rings and Algebraic stacks</em>
   <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  In the talk I will discuss the notion of Cox ring for an algebraic stack, 
  which extends the classical notion for varieties, via the language of torsors. 
  I will then present some applications and possible direction of research.
