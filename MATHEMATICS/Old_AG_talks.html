      Title: <em>Zero-sum cycles in flexible polyhedra</em>
      <br>
      <br>
    Abstract:  We show that if a polyhedron in the three-dimensional affine space with triangular faces is flexible, 
      i.e., can be continuously deformed preserving the shape of its faces, then there is a cycle of edges whose 
      lengths sum up to zero once suitably weighted by 1 and -1. We do this via elementary combinatorial considerations, 
      made possible by a well-known compactification of the three-dimensional affine space as a quadric in the 
      four-dimensional projective space. The compactification is related to the Euclidean metric, and allows us 
      to use a simple degeneration technique that reduces the problem to its one-dimensional analogue, which is trivial 
      to solve. This is a joint work with G. Grasegger, J. Legerský, and J. Schicho.

    Title: <em>Subvarieties of general hypersurfaces and their degree of irrationality</em>
      <br>
      <br>
    Abstract: I will be interested in discussing various birational invariants describing how a given variety X is far from being rational. 
      After introducing these invariants, I will focus on the case where X is a general hypersurface of large degree in the complex projective space. 
      In particular, I will report on recent results in collaboration with C. Ciliberto, F. Flamini and P. Supino, concerning the least degree 
      of irrationality of irreducible subvarieties of X of fixed dimension passing through a general point of X.

      Title: <em>Primary ideals and their differential equations</em>
      <br>
      <br>
    Abstract: An ideal in a polynomial ring encodes a system of linear partial differential equations with constant coefficients. 
      Primary decomposition organizes the solutions to the PDE. This paper develops a novel structure theory for primary ideals 
      in a polynomial ring. We characterize primary ideals in terms of PDE, punctual Hilbert schemes, relative Weyl algebras, 
      and the join construction. Solving the PDE described by a primary ideal amounts to computing Noetherian operators in the 
      sense of Ehrenpreis and Palamodov. We develop new algorithms for this task, and we present efficient implementations.

    Title: <em>Tangential weak defectiveness and generic identifiability</em>
    <br>
    <br>
    Abstract: We study the uniqueness of decomposition of general tensors T as a sum of tensors of rank 1. This is done by 
    extending the theory developed in a previous work by Mella to the framework of non-tangentially-weak-defective varieties. 
    In particular, the infinitesimal behaviour of the tangential contact locus is linked to the birational geometry of a 
    weakly defective but not tangentially defective variety. In this way it is possible to prove the non generic identifiability
    of infinitely many partially symmetric tensors.

    Title: <em>Togliatti systems, Weak Lefschetz Property and Galois coverings</em>
    <br>
    <br>
    Abstract: In an article in collaboration with Rosa M. Mirò-Roig and Giorgio Ottaviani (Canad. J. Math. 65, 2013), 
       we established a relation, due to apolarity, between Artinian homogeneous ideals of a polynomial ring not satisfying 
       the Weak Lefschetz Property - WLP - and projective varieties that verify a Laplace equation of a certain order s, i.e. 
       such that all the s-osculating spaces have dimension less than expected. Thanks to this relation, it is possible to 
       extend to various classes of toric varieties some classical results due to Eugenio Togliatti. In the seminar, I will 
       introduce these notions and I will speak of some recent results in collaboration with Liena Colarte and 
       Rosa M. Miro'-Roig, relating them to Galois cyclic coverings.

Title: <em>On secant defectiveness of toric varieties</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  Let N be a free abelian group, M = Hom(N,Z) its dual, M_Q := M ⊗ Q the corresponding rational vector space, 
    P ⊆ M_Q a full dimensional lattice polytope, and (X_P , H) the corresponding polarized toric variety. 
    We study the secant defectiveness of X_P in the embedding induced by H. In particular, we give a bound, depending 
    only on the maximum number of integer points on a facet of P, for the non secant defectiveness of X_P. 
    Furthermore, as an application, we get an almost asymptotically sharp bound for the non secant defectiveness of Segre-Veronese varieties.

Title: <em>Complete quadrics: Schubert calculus for Gaussian models and semidefinite programming</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  Algebraic geometry has made great advances in the last two centuries. A particular role was 
  played by enumerative geometry, where correct setting of moduli spaces found applications beyond mathematics.
  In my talk I would like to present a new work on applications of enumerative geometry in algebraic statistics. 
  The main role will be played by the classical variety of complete quadrics and its cohomology ring. However, 
  inspired by algebraic statistics, we will look at it from a different perspective, namely what happens when 
  the dimension of the quadric changes. We will present two theorems, confirming conjectures posed by Nie, Ranestad, 
  Sturmfels and Uhler. Achieving our results would not be possible without the fundamental work of De Concini, Laksov, 
  Lascoux, Pragacz and Procesi. The talk is based on joint works with Manivel, Monin, Seynnaeve, Vodicka and Wisniewski.

Title: <em>Exact solutions in low-rank approximation with zeros</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  Low-rank approximation with zeros aims to find a matrix of fixed rank and with a fixed zero pattern that minimizes 
  the Euclidean distance to a given data matrix. We study the critical points of this optimization problem using algebraic tools. 
  In particular, we describe special linear, affine and determinantal relations satisfied by the critical points. We also 
  investigate the number of critical points and how the number is related to the complexity of nonnegative matrix factorization problem. 
  This talk is based on a recent preprint together with Luca Sodomaco and Elias Tsigaridas.

Title: <em>On deformations and moduli of Fano varieties</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  Fano varieties are complex projective varieties with "positive curvature". They have a prominent role in algebraic geometry 
   for many reasons, there are very few of them, they constitute the basic building blocks of algebraic varieties.
   In this talk I will explain how their complex structure deforms and how it is possible to construct singular points 
   in the moduli space of K-polystable Fano varieties (i.e. Fano varieties admitting a Kähler-Einstein metric).
   This is joint work with Anne-Sophie Kaloghiros.

Title: <em>Intrinsic Grassmannians</em>
  <br>
  <br>
Abstract:  Generalizing the well-known weighted Grassmanians introduced by Corti and Reid, we study certain geometric 
      invariant theory quotients of the affine cone over the Plücker embedding of Gr(k,n). More precisely, 
      we consider normal projective varieties whose Cox ring is defined by the Plücker ideal I_{k,n}. For k = 2, 
      we classify the smooth Fano ones having Picard number two and give a concrete formula to compute their number for arbitrary n.
